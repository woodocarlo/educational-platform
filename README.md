## üé® About The Project

Traditional artisans possess incredible talent, but often lack the resources and technical skills to market their creations in the digital age. **Kalasakhi** (meaning 'Art Friend') is a revolutionary **AI-powered assistant** designed to help traditional Indian artisans digitally market their crafts through automated social media content generation, sophisticated image processing, and culturally-aware AI technologies.

Our goal is to help preserve cultural heritage by making it economically viable for artisans to continue their craft.

### üåü Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Kalasakhi stands out by offering a comprehensive, culturally-aware AI assistant specifically tailored for traditional Indian artisans. It bridges the gap between ancient art forms and modern digital marketing, enabling artisans to effortlessly create compelling online content, enhance product visuals, and reach a global audience, all while preserving the authenticity and heritage of their craft.

### ‚ú® Key Functional Features:

  * **AI-Powered Content Creation:** Automatically generate engaging social media posts with optimized captions and relevant hashtags.
  * **Podcast/Webinar Generation:** Create immersive audio and video content from voice samples, with multi-language support (English, Hindi, Punjabi, Haryanvi, Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati, Odia). Users can select length, auto-generate questions, or provide specific questions, and set a title.
  * **Photography Guidance:** Get AI-driven tips and DIY techniques for camera settings and simple setups to achieve professional-quality product photos using just a smartphone.
  * **Background Processing:** Leverage AI for professional-grade background removal and creative background generation to complement artwork.
  * **Creative Arena:** A dedicated space where artisans can generate podcasts, create social media posts by uploading photos, receive photoshoot guidance, and conceptualize their own posts.
  * **Art Gallery:** Users can upload their artwork, set a minimum price, and decide whether to publish it for sale or keep it in a private gallery.

### üöÄ Advanced Capabilities & Technologies:

Kalasakhi leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver its features:

  * **AI-Powered Social Media Post Generation:** An advanced AI system powered by the **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview API** transforms artwork descriptions into compelling, culturally-aware Instagram posts with captions, hashtags, and calls-to-action, supporting Hindi-English mixed content.
  * **Intelligent Background Removal System:** Professional-grade background removal for artwork photography is achieved using the **Remove.bg API**, ensuring clean product presentations with precise edge detection and transparency support.
  * **AI Creative Background Generation:** Contextual background generation that complements traditional artwork uses **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**, employing image analysis for color extraction, color theory, and cultural motif integration to create Instagram-optimized visuals (1080x1080).
  * **Multi-Image Thread Generation:** Creates cohesive Instagram story threads (5-slide narratives) that tell the complete story of traditional artworks, from technique to cultural significance, using AI-driven narrative structures.
  * **Advanced Image Processing Pipeline:** A comprehensive image enhancement system utilizes the **PIL/Pillow library** with advanced filters for color intelligence, quality optimization (brightness, contrast, saturation), and format/size optimization for social media.
  * **React-Based Frontend Architecture:** The modern, responsive web application is built with **React 18, Next.js (App Router)**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, providing an intuitive user experience.
  * **3D Visualization & Animation Support:** Advanced 3D capabilities for creating immersive artwork presentations are integrated using **React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber)**, **@react-three/drei**, and **Framer Motion 3D**. This enables features like virtual galleries and a link for users to visualize products in a home setting.
  * **Multi-Language & Cultural Intelligence:** Sophisticated language processing handles Hindi-English code-switching and cultural context in content generation through advanced NLP and prompt engineering, with an understanding of Indian traditional arts and regional specificities.
  * **API Integration Architecture:** A robust API management system handles multiple external services (Google Gemini, Remove.bg) with proper error handling, rate limiting, and secure API key management.
