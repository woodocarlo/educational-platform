 Sir Isaac Newton formulated three fundamental laws of motion, known as Newton's Laws of Motion. These laws describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. Let's dive into each law and its detailed explanation:

Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):
"An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will continue in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force."

[page]: 3

This law essentially states that objects tend to resist changes in their state of motion. The natural tendency of an object is to maintain its current state of motion, be it at rest or moving with a constant velocity, unless a force is exerted on it. This tendency is called inertia. Inertia is directly proportional to an object's mass, meaning that objects with more mass have greater inertia.

For example, if you slide a book on a table, it eventually comes to rest because of the force of friction acting against its motion. If you try to push a heavy box, it takes more force to get it moving than it does to move a lighter box.

Newton's Second Law of Motion:
"The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of acceleration is in the same direction as the net force."

[page]: 6

This law relates the concepts of force, mass, and acceleration. It states that when a force is applied to an object, it will accelerate in the direction of the force. The acceleration is directly proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

F = ma

Where:
F represents the net force acting on the object,
m is the mass of the object, and

[page]: 8
a is the resulting acceleration of the object.

This law explains that the greater the force applied to an object, the greater its acceleration will be. Similarly, an object with a larger mass requires more force to accelerate compared to an object with a smaller mass.

Newton's Third Law of Motion:
"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

This law states that when one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object. In other words, forces occur in pairs and act on two different objects. These forces are called action and reaction forces.

For example, if you push a wall, you exert a force on the wall, and the wall exerts an equal and opposite force back onto you. When a rocket launches, the expelled gas pushes backward, while the rocket moves forward due to the reaction force. These two forces are of equal magnitude but act in opposite directions.

These three laws of motion provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the behavior of objects in motion and the forces acting upon them. They form the basis of classical mechanics and are essential in many areas of physics and engineering.
